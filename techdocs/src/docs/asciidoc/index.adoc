== Chapter 1

This is an example document project set up with an automated build chain.

This document toolchain uses Asciidoc as the markup language.  Github also supports
this format in addition to regular markdown.

.References for Asciidoc:

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Writer's Guide]
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Full User Manual]

For the (debatable) sake of convenience, the tool chain has been set up using
Java for easier cross-platform portability and automated building although there
are other command line tools for every platform.  To use this approach you must
have Java and Maven installed in your path so that the `java` command and the `mvn`
command work from the command line.  You also need a bash shell, or you can read
the simple contents of `bin/gen-docs.sh` and perform the steps manually.

If you have the above requirements met, then all you need to do to generate the document
is to change to the root of your document project directory and run the
following command:

    bin/gen-docs.sh
